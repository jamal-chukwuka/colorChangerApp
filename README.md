## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
App Idea
An app that tracks environmental data for local farms and fisheries, offering a user-friendly way to monitor and visualize data trends. Features could include interactive maps, alert systems for environmental hazards, and basic analytics to highlight trends over time. This app would focus on simplicity and functionality, making it ideal for farmers and hobbyists concerned about environmental sustainability.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
It was a challenge connecting the objects to functions.
